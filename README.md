# Voyant API Examples

This repository contains lightweight and easy to augment examples for testing the Voyant API with installed Debian packages.

Full documentation for using the Voyant SDK, including this repository, is available at:
[voyant-photonics.github.io](https://voyant-photonics.github.io/).

## Instructions

Provided below is a minimal set of instructions designed to simplify the installation process and get the repository up and running on your system quickly. If needed, additional installation and usage instruction is available at:
[voyant-photonics.github.io](https://voyant-photonics.github.io/).

### Clone This Repository

Start by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Voyant-Photonics/voyant-sdk.git
```

### Docker Instructions

The recommended approach is to build the examples in our provided docker container,
which installs all dependencies and provides cross-platform support.

Follow the [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
documentation for installation instructions. Please be sure to install Docker Engine, and not Docker Desktop; installing the later prevents the api from functioning.

Once the docker container has been installed, build and run the [Voyant SDK docker container](/docker/Dockerfile):

> NOTE: The commands below represent the commands on linux based systems.
> Performing equivalent operations on other operating systems might require slightly different commands.

Build the container:

```bash
cd voyant-sdk/
docker build -t voyant-sdk-container -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name voyant-sdk-container --network host -v $(pwd):/workspace voyant-sdk-container /bin/bash
```

> Execute the following command if you wish to open a second terminal accessing the running docker container:
>
> ```bash
> docker exec -it voyant-sdk-container bash
> ```

### Building the Examples

Listed below are all instructions relating to building the provided examples.

```bash
cd [INSERT ONE OF THE TWO OPTIONS BELOW]
```
- `/workspace/` if building in the provided docker container (recommended. See [Docker Instructions](#docker-instructions) for relevant instruction.)
- `voyant-sdk/` if building on native system.

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The built resulting executables will be located in the `build/bin` directory.

### Running the Examples

Run the compiled binary example:

```bash
./bin/voyant_client_basic
```

If connected to a stream (simulated or from an external device), a feed of received messages similar to the sample below can will be displayed.

```bash
